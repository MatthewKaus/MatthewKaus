I am a graduate from the University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp, in Full Stack Web Development. 

Currently a Teaching Assistant at Trillogy Education Coding BootCamps.

It is my passion to become a programmer, as I have had a strong interest in technology from a young age. Starting from playing games, to building computers. It has been a pleasure to have been able to take the course in Full Stack Web Development.
